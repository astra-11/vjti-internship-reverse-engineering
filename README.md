# 🧠 VJTI CoE Internship – Reverse Engineering Challenges

This repository contains three reverse engineering tasks I solved as part of my internship at the **Centre of Excellence (CoE), VJTI Mumbai**. Each Windows-based executable required analysis to determine the correct input string that would cause the program to output `"Correct"`.
